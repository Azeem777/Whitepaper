The campaign will start at 1:00 pm GMT on June 29th, 2017. It will completely end in 28 days or when the Maximum cap is reached. **After that there is no more BET issued**. This document explains the distribution of BET and the details of the token sale campaign.

## BET price staging (exchange rate to ETH during the campaign period)

The first day will be power day. At this day the price for Dao.Casino token will be 2000 per 1ETH. Then the rate will change:

* 1st day 2000 BET = 1 Ether
* Day 2-15 1800 BET = 1 Ether

## 	Pre Sale  

2400 BET = 1 Ether, 400 BET will be added, as a vesting. It would last for a half a year, with 3 month cliff. 

## Dao.Casino token(BET) distribution

70/10/10/10 distribution: 70% will go to the campaign participants, 10% to the legal entity, 10% bounties, and 10% to the founders and early contributors who have worked on the project. Founders and early contributors will all have vesting.

## Founder vesting

Vesting is necessary, with no exceptions. It ensures, that founders would not cheat. Our main goal is to improve our project, save and protect it. That's why vesting is our way to show responsibility to all of our contributors.
Founders and early contributors will have 2 years vesting with 6 months cliff. This means we will mature 25% of our tokens each 6 months.

## Funds management

Funds raised in ether will be managed by a legal entity. Details about legal infrastructure and itâ€™s governance will be published before the token sale campaign starts. Purpose of the legal entity will be protocol R&D. Amongst the activities of the organisation: releasing a standalone client, security audit and whitelisting of the games from independent teams and is able to distribute funds as grants to the independent teams working on different aspects of the system, provide consultancy on usage of decentralised protocols in the context of gambling industry.
